# SixtyScan - Parkinson’s Voice Detection

This project aims to detect Parkinson’s Disease from short voice recordings using mel spectrograms and machine learning. It is part of a research effort to build accessible and early-stage PD screening tools through voice analysis.

## Project Overview

The system uses a CNN-based model (ResNet18) to classify voice data into two classes: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Non-PD. The system uses mel spectrograms and a ResNet-based CNN classifier to evaluate vocal impairments associated with PD, supporting early detection and digital health screening. (This is a student project, not an official medical tool)
